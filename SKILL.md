# Moral Urgency Argument

Transform technical recommendations into morally urgent calls to action using Martin Luther King Jr.'s prophetic rhetoric framework. This skill applies King's persuasive methodology - grounding arguments in shared values, naming contradictions between stated beliefs and actual practices, painting achievable visions of the better state, addressing the "moderate" who agrees in principle but counsels waiting, and culminating in specific calls to collective action. King's rhetoric was effective not because of emotional manipulation but because it connected proposals to moral principles the audience already held, making inaction feel like complicity. This same structure can transform mundane technical proposals into compelling cases for change. The skill is particularly valuable when good ideas have failed to gain traction despite their merit, when organizational inertia blocks necessary improvements, and when advocates need to help stakeholders see that delay itself is a choice with consequences.

## When to Use

- User needs to advocate for necessary technical change
- Persuasive proposals that have failed to gain traction
- Overcoming organizational inertia on important issues
- Making the case for refactoring, tech debt payment, or process improvements
- "Help me make the case for..."
- "Write a persuasive argument for..."
- "How do I convince leadership to..."
- When delay has become the default response to important proposals

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| topic | Yes | The issue or change being advocated |
| current_state | Yes | The problem or gap being addressed |
| desired_state | Yes | The solution or vision |
| objections | No | Anticipated "wait," "not now," or "too risky" objections |
| audience | No | Who needs to be persuaded |

## Core Principle

King's prophetic rhetoric worked because it grounded arguments in values the audience already held, then revealed the gap between stated values and actual practice. Moral urgency comes not from emotional manipulation but from showing that delay itself is a choice with consequences. The move from "I" to "we" transforms individual advocacy into collective commitment.

---

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Identify the Moral Ground

What shared value does the audience hold that connects to this issue?

1. Identify the principles the audience claims to believe
2. Find the value they already hold but aren't living up to
3. Ground the argument in their stated commitments
4. Connect technical concerns to values (reliability, user experience, team health, craftsmanship)

### Phase 2: Name the Contradiction

How does the current state violate stated principles?

1. Gather specific evidence: incidents, metrics, complaints, burnout
2. Articulate the gap between values and practice
3. Use the formula: "We say we value X, yet our current practices produce Y"
4. Make the contradiction undeniable

### Phase 3: Paint the Vision

What would living up to stated values look like?

1. Make it concrete and achievable (not utopian)
2. Use "Imagine if..." and "Picture a world where..." constructions
3. Show the achievable better state clearly
4. Connect vision to practical outcomes

### Phase 4: Address the Moderate

Respond to those who agree in principle but counsel waiting:

| Objection Type | Response Pattern |
|----------------|------------------|
| "Wrong timing" | "The time is always right to do what is right" |
| "Too risky" | "The greater risk is continued inaction" |
| "Other priorities" | "This IS the priority if we're honest about our values" |
| "Be patient" | "Wait almost always means never; the fierce urgency of now" |
| "We need more data" | "We have enough data to know this matters" |

### Phase 5: Call to Action

End with specific, achievable next steps:

1. Move from "I propose" to "Let us together"
2. Name the first concrete action
3. Use anaphora for emphasis ("Now is the time to...")
4. Make commitment feel like joining a worthy cause
5. Close with collective invitation

## Output Format

```markdown
## [Title of Argument]

[Opening that grounds in shared values - 1-2 sentences invoking principles the audience already holds]

[Naming the contradiction - How current state violates those values, with specific evidence]

[The vision - Concrete description of the better state, using "imagine" or "picture"]

[Addressing objections - Anticipate and respond to "wait" arguments]

[Call to action with anaphora:]
- Now is the time to [first action].
- Now is the time to [second action].
- Now is the time to [third action].

Let us begin together.
```

## Constraints

- Do not create arguments for unethical purposes or harmful outcomes
- Do not misattribute quotes or fabricate King's words
- Do not use moral language to manipulate rather than persuade
- Do not create arguments that dehumanize opponents
- Do not apply prophetic rhetoric to trivial issues (reserve for genuinely important matters)
- Moral framing requires moral foundation - if the cause isn't worthy, don't use this skill

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Weaponizing moral language for trivial issues** | Using prophetic rhetoric for minor preferences dilutes its power and appears manipulative; reserve for genuinely important matters |
| **Attacking persons rather than problems** | King's rhetoric opposed injustice while respecting opponents as persons; personal attacks undermine moral authority |
| **Fabricating urgency where none exists** | The skill reveals genuine urgency, not manufactures false urgency; if the situation isn't truly urgent, simpler persuasion is appropriate |
| **Skipping the shared values grounding** | Without establishing common ground first, moral arguments feel like lectures; the audience must recognize the values as their own |
| **Demanding without inviting** | King moved from "I" to "we" - the call to action must invite participation, not just demand compliance |
| **Ignoring legitimate objections** | Some objections have merit; addressing them honestly strengthens the argument, while dismissing them undermines credibility |

## Examples

### Example 1: Technical Debt Advocacy

**Situation:**
- topic: Paying down technical debt in the authentication service
- current_state: Multiple incidents in past quarter, on-call burden, fear of making changes
- desired_state: Reliable, maintainable auth service engineers aren't afraid to touch
- objections: "We have feature work to ship," "Not the right time"
- audience: Engineering leadership

**Application:**

## The Fierce Urgency of Authentication

We hold these truths to be self-evident: that reliable systems are the foundation of user trust, that sustainable engineering practices are the foundation of team health, and that technical excellence is not a luxury but a necessity.

Yet we find ourselves in a familiar and troubling position. Our authentication service - the very gateway through which every user passes - has become a source of fear rather than confidence. Three incidents in the past quarter. Seventeen on-call escalations. Engineers who confess privately that they are afraid to touch the code. We have signed a promissory note to ourselves, promising to address these issues "when we have time." But that check has been returned marked insufficient funds.

Imagine an authentication service that simply works. Where deploys are routine rather than heroic. Where engineers volunteer for on-call rather than dread it. Where the team that owns this critical path can move with confidence rather than trepidation. This is not fantasy - it is the natural result of the principles we already claim to hold.

Some will counsel patience: "We have feature work to ship." But I ask you: what feature matters if users cannot log in? "The timing isn't right." But the time is always right to do what is right. "We'll get to it next quarter." But "next quarter" has become "never quarter," and the fierce urgency of the present demands that we no longer defer the maintenance we know our systems require.

Now is the time to allocate dedicated capacity for authentication reliability.
Now is the time to establish clear SLOs and hold ourselves accountable.
Now is the time to make the invisible visible - to create dashboards that show our progress.

I cannot fix this alone. None of us can. But together, we can transform this service from a source of anxiety into a source of pride. Let us begin this week. Let us begin together.

### Example 2: Process Improvement

**Situation:** A team wants to advocate for better code review practices after a series of production bugs.

**Application:**

**Shared values grounding:** "We believe quality is everyone's responsibility."

**Contradiction:** "Yet we merged 47 pull requests last month with zero reviewer comments - our 'review' process has become a rubber stamp."

**Vision:** "Imagine PRs where reviewers catch bugs before users do, where knowledge transfers across the team, where 'approved' means genuinely reviewed."

**Addressing objections:** "Some say reviews slow us down. I say: the hours spent fixing production bugs last month far exceed the hours thorough reviews would have cost."

**Call to action:** "Let us commit to meaningful review starting today."

## Integration

**Works with:**
- **persuasion-through-narrative**: Story-based advocacy complements moral urgency
- **stakeholder-analysis**: Understanding audience enables better grounding in shared values
- **technical-communication**: Clear technical explanation supports the argument

**When to prefer this skill:**
- Use when technical merit alone has failed to persuade
- Use when delay has become the default response
- Use when the issue genuinely matters

**Cautions:**
- This is powerful rhetoric; use only for worthy causes
- If the underlying cause isn't sound, no amount of rhetoric will help
